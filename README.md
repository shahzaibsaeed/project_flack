# Project FLACK

OVERVIEW:

Flack is the chatting web application inspired by SLACK, which is developed by SOCKET.IO and FLASK-SOCKET.IO. In Flask, many users can chat with each other in different channels. Any user can create new channel. Messages up to 100 of every channels are stored in the server-side memory and can be accessible to every new user. For personal touch, I include USER TYPING feature, other users in the same channel can able to see who is typing the message at the moment.
