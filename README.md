# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

OVERVIEW:

Flack is the chatting web application inspired by SLACK, which is developed by SOCKET.IO and FLASK-SOCKET.IO. In Flask, many users can chat with each other in different channels. Any user can create new channel. Messages up to 100 of every channels are stored in the server-side memory and can be accessible to every new user.

For personal touch, I include USER TYPING feature, other users in the same channel can able to see who is typing the message at the moment.

DISPLAY NAME:
When user first time open the app in the browser, I asked them for their display name by popping up the prompt and I saved the display name of every users in their browser's memory.

CHANNEL LIST:
Channel list is saved on the server-side memory through which can e accessible to every new users.

MESSAGE VIEW:
Messages of every channel are also stored on the server-side memory with the information of user, time and channel. These messages can be stored up to 100 messages.

SENDING MESSAGES:
Due to Socket.io and Flask-Socket.io, users can be able to send messages to each other at real time without reloading the page in the respective channels.

REMEMBERING THE CHANNEL:
I saved the information of current channel in the browser's memory every time when user switchs from one channel to another.

PERSONAL TOUCH:
As a personal touch, I add the “USER TYPING” functionality in the app where user can see which user is currently typing the message.
